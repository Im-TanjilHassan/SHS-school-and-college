                SHS’s modest roots began in 1985 with Alex Shchegol and 12 students in a small Manhattan classroom. Known then as ‘Advanced Software Analysis’, the College focused on computer programming, as New York City had a dire shortage of qualified mainframe programmers at that time.

                Since then, the college has grown to more than 3000 students, 20 programs of study, and 2 large, centrally-located campuses in midtown Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn as well as one campus in Hialeah, Florida. Today, in addition to computer technology, our programs focus on the rapidly-growing industries of healthcare, business and criminal justice.

                Over the years, as technology revolutionized how every major industry operates, SHS created and updated programs of study to meet new market needs. Consistent with the demands and capabilities of our stu­dent body, which includes highly motivated and mature immigrants, SHS programs have always featured a “hands-on” training component.

                In 1999, SHS received authorization from the New York State Board of Regents to confer degrees in accounting, computer programming and information technology and medical assisting.

                SHS College received initial institutional accreditation from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in 2010 and received decennial reaccreditation in March 2015. SHS’s Associate Degree program in Medical Assisting is programmatically accredited by the Medical Assisting Education Review Board (MAERB) of the Commission for Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP).
